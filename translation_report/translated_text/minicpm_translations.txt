Hi William,

We are planning to develop a hard-sided book with 12 pages. We need your advice on the materials we should use for embossing. Could you recommend the thickness of the coated paper needed to ensure the book's hardness and durability?

Additionally, if the cover is processed with powdered kerosene, the cost will be higher than the normal glazing. Could you estimate the cost increase for this process?

Please base your recommendations on the following specifications:

- **Size**: 8 inches x 8 inches
- **Page Count**: 12 pages (6 spreads)
- **Material**: 400g white cardboard embossed
- **Printing**: 4C/4C

Thank you for your expert advice.

Regards,
Emily

Hello William,

I am pleased to receive the hard copy of the product, which is of good quality but has a few issues:

1.  One of the pages has a slight air bubbles, which is necessary to be avoided during the production process.
2.  The glare on the front cover is a bit thin, and some areas are not as bright as expected. We would like to have a more deep and opaque glaze effect. Could you recommend a glaze oil or paint? Additionally, if possible, we would like to increase the layer thickness of the glaze?

Please confirm these questions will be addressed in the product. I will make sure to revise and finalize the revised order.

Best regards,
Sarah
