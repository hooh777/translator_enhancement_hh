Subject: Inquiry Regarding Board Book Material

Body:

Hi William,

We are planning a new board book and have some questions about materials:

Our design consists of 12 pages, using 400 gsm white card paper laminated together. What thickness of greyboard do you recommend for the lining to ensure the book’s rigidity and durability?

Additionally, if the cover is treated with poker varnishing compared to a standard matte coating, approximately how much would the cost increase?

Please provide a quotation for 3,000 / 5,000 copies based on the following tentative specifications:

Dimensions: 8" x 8"
Pages: 12 pages (6 spreads)
Material: 400 gsm white card paper laminated together

We look forward to your professional recommendations.

Regards,

Emily

Subject: Feedback on Sample for Order #S20240608

Body:

Hi William,

We have received the board book sample, and the overall quality is good, but there are two minor issues:

One page’s lining has slight air bubbles, which must be avoided in bulk production.
The cover’s matte coating feels slightly thin, with uneven reflection in some areas. We prefer a deeper matte effect. Is it possible to use matte ink or increase the coating thickness?
Please confirm whether these issues can be resolved in bulk production. We will confirm the order upon your response.

Regards,

Sarah

Subject: Quote: Single Book with Multiple Cover Versions

Body:

Hi Team,

We plan to publish a paperback book with four different cover designs to target different markets.

Text Block (identical for all versions):
Dimensions: 6" x 9"

Cover (4 versions with different designs, same specifications):
Paper: 250 gsm coated paper
Printing: 4C + 0C
Finishing: Matte laminated
Total Quantity: 8,000 copies (2,000 copies per cover version)
Would this approach be more cost-effective than printing four separate orders of 2,000 copies each?
