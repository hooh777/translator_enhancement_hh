Case 10: Feedback on Sample Quality for a Board Book Order

Subject: Feedback on Sample for Order #S20240608

Dear William,

We have received the board book sample, and the overall quality is good, but there are two minor issues:

One page has slight air bubbles in the inner lining, which must be avoided in full production.
The coverâ€™s matte coating appears thin, with uneven gloss in some areas. We prefer a deeper matte effect. Is it possible to use matte ink or increase the coating thickness?
Please confirm whether these issues can be resolved in full production. We will confirm the order upon your response.

Regards,

Sarah
