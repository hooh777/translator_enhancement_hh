Hi Team, Please be advised that the client has requested a change to the material specifications for their upcoming order of color boxes. The main structure must now be made from 2mm thick greyboard for added rigidity, not the standard paperboard we quoted. For the exterior, we will be laminating 157 gsm coated paper onto the surface. The final product requires individual shrink wrap for protection during shipping. Please update the bill of materials and confirm the new cost immediately. Thanks.",

They loved the main box cover with the holographic foil stamping. For the cards themselves, they want to ensure we use a professional poker varnishing for the best feel. The box itself should be a sturdy slipcase to hold everything securely. Please confirm that these changes are feasible and let's proceed with the full production run. Best regards.",
