We are moving forward with a full hardcover book, which will be protected by an outer jacket. The core of the cover will be constructed from a very thick and rigid paperboard to prevent any bending. For the pages themselves, the client has signed off on using a high-grade 120gsm book paper. A key feature will be the decorative endpaper, which will have a custom map design printed on it. Please ensure all these details are communicated to the factory. The goal is a premium, collectible item, so quality control on the hardcover construction is paramount. Thanks.",

Instead, the main product, a boardbook for infants, will be housed in a simple cardboard sleeve for protection. The boardbook itself needs to be very safe, so please ensure we use a water-based gloss ink for all the printing.
