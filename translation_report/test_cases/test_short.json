The client has approved all materials. The main book will be a high-quality hardback, presented in a protective slipcase. The slipcase itself must be constructed from sturdy 2.5mm greyboard to ensure it is not flimsy. A key feature is that the jacket for the book requires a special matt laminated finish for a premium, non-reflective feel. We must adhere to the following for the book's construction:\n\n- Cover: Standard hardcover wrapped in faux leather, with the title using holographic foil stamping.\n- Endpapers: Custom-printed 140gsm book paper for the front and back endpaper.\n- Interior Paper: 100gsm matte coated paper for all pages.\n\nThis project is high-priority as of June 20, 2025. Please review these specs carefully and confirm the production timeline by end of day. Any questions, let me know. Thanks.",
